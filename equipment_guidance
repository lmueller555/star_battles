Durability values are the item’s maximum at Level 1 (L1).

Global Combat / Stat Rules

Hit Chance

hit_chance = clamp01((AttackerAccuracy - DefenderAvoidance) / accuracy_scale)


Use your engine’s global accuracy_scale (e.g., 400 = baseline).

Negative results clamp to 0.

Avoidance comes from the ship + modules (e.g., Light RCS Ducting +15).

Armor & Armor Piercing

EffectiveArmor = max(0, Armor - ArmorPiercing)
DamageTaken = RawDamage * (1 - EffectiveArmor / 100)


Clamp final value ≥ 0.

Criticals
On hit, compute crit using attacker’s Critical Offense vs defender’s Critical Defense (as defined in combat model).

Firing Arc
Degrees the hardpoint can legally fire within (do not roll beyond this).

Reload
Cooldown between shots.

Power Cost
Energy removed from the ship per shot or activation.

Upgrade Axes
Only attributes labeled “(upgrades)” scale with item level.
Other values remain constant unless higher-level screenshots show changes.

Implementation Notes:

Uses standard ballistic hit, armor, and crit formulas.

Consumes full Power Cost instantly on fire; cannot re-queue until Reload completes.

Accuracy 125 is balanced for large targets (Line/Capital); less effective against Strike-class ships.

Apply standard range falloff using Optimal Range (peak DPS ≈ 675 m).

Restricted to Line-class hardpoints — enforce requirement in Store and Fitting UI.

Weapons (Medium / Heavy Hardpoints – Line Only)

MEC-L34(S) “Cyclone” — Heavy Cannon Battery (L1)
