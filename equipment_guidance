Scope: Items usable by Strike ships. Units: meters (m), m/s, deg/s, deg/s², seconds, currency shown as the UI displays (e.g., 10,000). Durability values are the item’s max at L1.

Global combat/stat rules (for the engine to use consistently)

Hit chance: hit_chance = clamp01( (AttackerAccuracy - DefenderAvoidance) / accuracy_scale )
– Use your game’s accuracy_scale (e.g., 400 = baseline). Negative values clamp to 0.
– Avoidance comes from the ship + modules (e.g., Light RCS Ducting +15).

Armor & AP: EffectiveArmor = max(0, Armor - ArmorPiercing);
DamageTaken = RawDamage * (1 - EffectiveArmor/100) (clamped ≥ 0).

Criticals: On hit, compute crit using attacker’s Critical Offense vs defender’s Critical Defense (already defined in your combat model).

Firing arc: Degrees the hardpoint can legally fire within (don’t roll the mount beyond this).

Reload: Cooldown between shots.

Power cost: Energy removed from the ship per shot/activation.

Upgrade axes: For the L1 items below, note which fields upgrade. If not listed as “(upgrades)”, keep the value constant across levels unless you later capture higher-level screenshots.

Armor Piercing: 5

Range: 0–600 m

Optimal Range: 250 m

Accuracy: 400

Reload: 0.4 s

Power Cost: 1

Firing Arc: 75°

Cost: 10,000

Durability: 2500 / 2500

Upgrade model: Increase Damage and Critical Offense. Fast, crit-leaning variant.

Implementation notes (all four autocannons):

Use Optimal Range to apply your standard range falloff (e.g., peak DPS near optimal, degrade toward max).

Accuracy 400 plugs into your hit formula; AP 5 into armor math.

If multiple identical cannons are mounted, track independent reloads.

Hull systems (Strike / Light hull slot, passive)
Strike Composite Plating (L1)

Armor Value: +2.25

Hull Points: +22.5

Acceleration: −0.3

Turn Acceleration: −0.75 deg/s²

Cost: 8,000

Durability: 2500 / 2500

Effect: Mixed survivability (armor + hull) with small maneuver penalties.

Upgrade axis: If you capture higher levels, expect Armor and Hull to scale; penalties typically remain constant per level unless UI shows otherwise.

Strike Hull Plating (L1)

Hull Points: +45

Acceleration: −0.2

Turn Acceleration: −1.0 deg/s²

Cost: 8,000

Durability: 2500 / 2500

Effect: Larger flat hull buffer; slightly heavier turn-accel penalty.

Upgrade axis: Hull Points scale with level.

Strike Armor Plating (L1)

Armor Value: +4.5

Acceleration: −0.4

Turn Acceleration: −0.5 deg/s²

Cost: 8,000

Durability: 2500 / 2500

Effect: Stronger Armor boost; biggest linear accel penalty of the three.

Upgrade axis: Armor Value scales with level.

Hull module application order (recommended):

Recompute max_hull = base + sum(hull_points_mods); clamp current hull to new max.

armor = base + sum(armor_value_mods)

Add kinematic penalties/bonuses: lin_accel += sum(accel_deltas); turn_accel += sum(turn_accel_deltas).

Engine systems (Strike / Light engine slot, passive)
Light Drive Overcharger (L1)

Speed: +1.25 m/s

Boost Speed: +1.25 m/s

Cost: 5,000

Durability: 2500 / 2500

Effect: Flat increases to cruise & boost top speeds.

Upgrade axis: Speed and Boost Speed scale.

Light Turbo Boosters (L1)

Acceleration: +1.0

Boost Speed: +2.5 m/s

Cost: 5,000

Durability: 2500 / 2500

Effect: Better sprint; adds linear acceleration and higher boost cap.

Upgrade axis: Acceleration and Boost Speed scale.

Light Gyro-Stabilization (L1)

Turn Speed: +2.5 deg/s

Turn Acceleration: +2.5 deg/s²

Cost: 5,000

Durability: 2500 / 2500

Effect: Improves rotational performance.

Upgrade axis: Turn Speed & Turn Acceleration scale.

Light RCS Ducting (L1) — NEW

Avoidance: +15

Cost: 5,000

Durability: 2500 / 2500

Effect: Increases Avoidance (harder to hit with cannons).

Upgrade axis: Avoidance scales with level.

Engine module application order (recommended):
max_speed += sum(speed_bonus); boost_speed += sum(boost_bonus); lin_accel += sum(accel_bonus); turn_rate += sum(turn_speed_bonus); turn_accel += sum(turn_accel_bonus); avoidance += sum(avoidance_bonus).

Store/fit rules for Strike items

Eligibility: Ship class must be Strike (enforce in Store & Fitting).

Stacking: Same family modules stack additively unless you later add DR (diminishing returns).

Durability & cost: Show item Durability and Price on the card. Items at 0% cannot function until repaired.

Preview deltas: On hover/select, compute the delta vs current ship (+X / −Y) and show it in green/red for: Speed, Boost Speed, Accel, Turn Speed/Accel, Avoidance, Armor, Hull, etc.

Upgrade preview: If the user holds the “Max Upgrade” hotkey (your UI shows [SHIFT]), switch the stat block to show the level-cap values (once you’ve captured them).
