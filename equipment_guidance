Reload: 2.5 s
Power Cost: 9
Firing Arc: 90°
Cost: 175,000
Durability: 18,000 / 18,000
Requirements: Ship class Escort; can only target Capital-class ships.

Effect:
Specialized medium cannon battery that allows an Escort ship (Scythe-only in source game, but treat as “anti-capital” archetype) to directly threaten Capital hulls. High armor piercing and strong per-shot damage balanced by a narrow arc and moderate reload. Should not be usable against Strike/Escort/Line targets in the targeting logic.

Upgrade Model:
Damage scales with level; all other stats remain fixed unless higher-level data indicate changes.

Implementation Notes:

Use normal cannon ballistic model (projectile flight optional or instant-hit, as per engine standard).

Apply standard hit/crit/armor formulas; Capital-only restriction is enforced in target filtering.

Narrow 90° arc encourages deliberate nose-on attack runs or fixed broadside mounts.

Mark internally as “AntiCapitalOnly = true” so AI and UI can clearly communicate its role.

AC-M Nuclear Warhead Launcher — Capital-Killer Missile (Maul-Exclusive, L1)
Damage: 1800–2100 (L1) → 2200–2700 (max) (upgrades)
Armor Piercing: 60
Range: 1350–1900 m (L1) → 1350–2200 m (max) (upgrades)

Speed: 90 m/s
Critical Offense: 200
Reload: 16 s (L1) → 12 s (max) (upgrades)
Power Cost: 42
Firing Arc: 180°
Cost: 215,000
Durability: 18,000 / 18,000
Requirements: Ship: Maul (Escort)

Effect:
Escort-mounted strategic nuclear warhead designed to deliver catastrophic damage to Capital-class targets. Very high base damage and armor piercing, long effective range, and wide 180° launch arc. Constrained by slow reload and heavy power draw, making each shot a major commitment.

Upgrade Model:
Damage, maximum Range, and Reload time improve with level (shorter reload). Power Cost remains constant unless higher-level data show changes.

Implementation Notes:

Uses guided missile logic; warhead tracks like a slow but persistent torpedo (90 m/s, 30 deg/s turn).

Apply large explosion effects and potentially AOE vs nearby large ships, as desired for cinematic impact.

Intended primarily for use against Line/Capital ships; you can optionally give it reduced hit chance vs small targets.

Mark internally as “Nuclear”/“Strategic” to gate usage in missions and balance passes.

ASM-12 “Agrius” — Nuclear Torpedo Launcher (Escort, L1)
Damage: 600–1000
Armor Piercing: 25

Turn Speed: 70 deg/s
Speed: 85 m/s
Critical Offense: 100
Reload: 240 s (L1) → 190 s (max) (upgrades)
Power Cost: 70 (L1) → 58.5 (max) (upgrades)
Firing Arc: 180°
Explosion Radius: 400 m
Cost: 60,000
Durability: 18,000 / 18,000
Requirements: Ship class Escort

Effect:
Escort-class nuclear torpedo delivering massive hull and power-grid damage in a large blast radius. Best used as an opening salvo or objective-breaking tool, not for sustained DPS. Very long reload and heavy energy cost limit it to deliberate, high-impact shots.

Upgrade Model:
Power Damage, maximum Range, Reload time, and Power Cost scale with level. Base kinetic Damage stays fixed unless higher-level values indicate otherwise.

Implementation Notes:

Guided torpedo with modest speed/turn; easy to dodge at long range without proper setup (e.g., slows).

Apply both hull damage and additional “power damage” to target’s energy pool or power-related subsystem.

Explosion radius should affect all valid targets in 400 m, with normal hit/crit rolls per affected ship if you support that.

Mark as a special/rare weapon for late-game Escort builds.

Implementation Notes:

Guided missiles using standard hit, crit, and armor rules.

180° frontal arc with lock-on; projectiles travel at 100 m/s with good agility vs medium targets.

Serves as the “baseline” stat reference for the Thunderbolt family (M and P variants).

HD-M50(M) “Thunderbolt” — Medium Missile Battery (Multi-Targeting, L1)

Multi-targeting variant of the Thunderbolt system. Trades no raw stat compared to the standard version but gains the ability to engage multiple locked targets per volley (as allowed by your targeting model). Ideal for Escorts providing distributed pressure across several enemies or missiles.

Upgrade Model:
Same as Thunderbolt(S): Range, Reload, and Power Cost scale with level.

Implementation Notes:

Use the same projectile stats and damage model as the S-variant.

Add logic to split salvos across N targets (e.g., nearest or highest-priority within arc/lock cone).

Clearly mark in UI as “Multi-Targeting” and reflect that in tooltips/fitting screen.

Firing Arc: 180°
Cost: 15,000
Durability: 18,000 / 18,000
Requirements: Ship class Escort

Effect:
Precision variant of the Thunderbolt battery. Maintains general-purpose stats while emphasizing higher crit potential and multi-targeting behavior. Suited for Escorts that lean on crit-focused builds and coordinated missile salvos.

Upgrade Model:
Critical Offense, Range, Reload time, and Power Cost all scale with level. Base Damage remains fixed unless higher-level screenshots indicate otherwise.

Implementation Notes:

Same missile kinematics as other Thunderbolt variants.

Multi-targeting recommended (matches in-game behavior) — treat this as both a crit-buffed and multi-target capable version.

Ensure crit bonuses apply after armor reduction, consistent with your global crit model.
