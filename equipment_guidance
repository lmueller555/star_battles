Equipment Guidance Document

Scope: Items usable by ships in the classes Strike, Escort, Line, and Capital.
Units: meters (m), m/s, deg/s, deg/s², seconds, currency shown as UI (e.g., 10,000).
Durability values are the item’s maximum at Level 1 (L1).

Global Combat / Stat Rules

Hit Chance

hit_chance = clamp01((AttackerAccuracy - DefenderAvoidance) / accuracy_scale)

Use your engine’s global accuracy_scale (e.g., 400 = baseline).

Negative results clamp to 0.

Avoidance comes from the ship + modules (e.g., Light RCS Ducting +15).

Armor & Armor Piercing

EffectiveArmor = max(0, Armor - ArmorPiercing)
DamageTaken = RawDamage * (1 - EffectiveArmor / 100)

Clamp final value ≥ 0.

Criticals
On hit, compute crit using attacker’s Critical Offense vs defender’s Critical Defense (as defined in combat model).

Firing Arc
Degrees the hardpoint can legally fire within (do not roll beyond this).

Reload
Cooldown between shots.

Power Cost
Energy removed from the ship per shot or activation.

Upgrade Axes
Only attributes labeled “(upgrades)” scale with item level.
Other values remain constant unless higher-level screenshots show changes.

Optimal Range: 2750 m (upgrades)
Accuracy: 125
Critical Offense: 100
Reload: 8 s
Power Cost: 64
Firing Arc: 35°
Cost: 500 000
Durability: 20 000 / 20 000

Effect:
High-caliber artillery cannon for Capital-class vessels.
Delivers devastating long-range firepower designed for siege and ship-of-the-line engagements.
Extremely limited firing arc and long reload, balanced by immense per-shot impact and armor penetration.
Incapable of reliably hitting Strike-class ships due to target size and slow traverse.

Upgrade Model:
Increase Damage and Optimal Range per level. Reload and Power Cost remain fixed unless higher-level data show changes.

Implementation Notes:

Uses standard ballistic and crit formulas; apply standard falloff from Optimal Range (peak DPS ≈ 2750 m).

Designed for broadside or fixed forward mounts — do not allow 360° traversal.

Each shot consumes full Power Cost at the moment of firing.

Accuracy tuned for large, slow targets (Line or Capital classes).

Minimum effective range (≈ 2300 m) prevents close-range use; enforce via targeting logic.

Restricted to Capital-class hardpoints — enforce requirement in Store and Fitting UI.

Consider adding screen-shake and concussive sound effects for cinematic impact.

Weapons (Defensive / Support Hardpoints – Capital Only)

PD-X30P “Wildfire” — 25mm Point Defense Battery (L1)

Damage: 3 – 7 (upgrades)
Armor Piercing: 5

Extremely high rate of fire and accuracy make it ideal for layered point defense at close range.
Poor performance against heavily armored or distant targets.

Upgrade Model:
Increase Damage and Range per level. Reload and Power Cost remain fixed unless higher-level data indicate changes.

Implementation Notes:

Functions as a CIWS (Close-In Weapon System) with automatic engagement capability.

Should prioritize hostile missiles, drones, and small ships within 1 km.

Uses projectile-based logic; apply hit rolls per shot with standard accuracy formula.

Accuracy 500 ensures reliable tracking at short range.

Low Armor Piercing prevents meaningful hull damage to Line or Capital ships.

Restricted to Capital-class defensive hardpoints — enforce eligibility in Store and Fitting UI.

Consider adding continuous tracer fire and tracking audio cues for visual clarity.

Weapons (Defensive / Support Hardpoints – Capital Only)

M-37A “Fusillade” — 6.3mm Spot Flak (L1)

Power Cost: 5
Firing Arc: 45°
Cost: 450 000
Durability: 25 000 / 25 000

Effect:
Short-arc defensive flak cannon designed for Capital-class ships.
Fires directed explosive shells that detonate near incoming threats within a narrow arc.
Highly effective at intercepting missiles and small craft in a defined coverage zone.
Combines concentrated damage bursts with limited field of fire — best used in coordinated flak grids.

Upgrade Model:
Increase Damage and Range per level. Reload and Power Cost remain fixed unless higher-level data indicate otherwise.

Implementation Notes:

Uses proximity detonation model with small explosive radius (≈10–20 m).

Moderate Armor Piercing allows it to damage lightly armored ships but remains defensive in intent.

Accuracy 300 reflects area saturation rather than precision targeting.

Power Cost applied per volley; independent reloads per turret.

Firing arc limited to 45° to simulate fixed, directional flak turrets — avoid auto-tracking beyond arc.

Restricted to Capital-class defensive hardpoints — enforce requirement in Store and Fitting UI.

Consider pairing with Wildfire CIWS systems for comprehensive defense layering.

Effective for intercepting multiple simultaneous threats within a hemisphere around the ship.

Upgrade Model:
Increase Damage and Range per level. Reload and Power Cost remain constant unless higher-level data indicate otherwise.

Implementation Notes:

Uses flak-type proximity detonation with moderate blast radius (≈15–25 m).

Accuracy 300 represents area-saturation fire; not intended for precision targeting.

180° arc allows broad coverage for defensive screens around vulnerable ship zones.

Power Cost applied per volley; independent reload timers per turret.

Works best in pairs or grids with spot flak for complete coverage.

Restricted to Capital-class defensive hardpoints — enforce requirement in Store and Fitting UI.

Consider visual flak bursts and impact shock effects for cinematic feedback.

Increase Damage and Range per level. Reload and Power Cost remain constant unless higher-level data indicate otherwise.

Implementation Notes:

Guided missile logic with 45°/s turn rate and 95 m/s projectile speed.

Each missile uses standard hit, crit, and armor calculations upon detonation.

360° firing arc allows full-coverage targeting but should obey targeting lock rules (cannot fire through ship geometry).

Designed for anti-capital and anti-line engagements — inefficient versus Strike-class ships.

Restricted to Capital-class hardpoints — enforce requirement in Store and Fitting UI.

Consider adding missile trail and exhaust visual effects for cinematic impact.

Designed for standoff bombardment and anti-capital engagements, trading sustained DPS for devastating alpha-strike potential.
Missiles cannot effectively engage small Strike-class vessels due to sensor resolution limits.

Upgrade Model:
Increase Damage and Range per level. Reload and Power Cost remain fixed unless higher-level data show differences.

Implementation Notes:

Guided missile logic using 30°/s turn rate and 110 m/s travel speed.

Each missile performs independent hit, crit, and armor calculations on impact.

Power Cost applied upon missile launch.

Long reload (30 s) limits sustained fire; best suited for coordinated salvos.

120° firing arc represents forward DRADIS lock zone — requires target acquisition before launch.

Optimized for long-range sieges and fleet support fire; ineffective versus agile ships.

Restricted to Capital-class hardpoints — enforce in Store and Fitting UI.

Consider adding visible lock-on indicator and long-trail missile effects for cinematic clarity.
