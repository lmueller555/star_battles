Ship Classes, Roles, Specs, and Implementation Rules
1) Taxonomy & Identity
1.1 Size Classes

Strike (Light): small silhouette, high agility, low armor/hull.

Escort (Medium): balanced mobility/survivability, more hardpoints.

Line (Heavy): tanky, slow turn/accel, heavy weapon arrays.

Capital (XL): carriers/battlestars; special slot families (guns, launchers, defensive weapons), logistics/respawn roles.

1.2 Combat Roles

Interceptor: speed/agility specialists. More engine slots (and even more when upgraded).

Assault: frontline brawler/tank. More hull slots (and even more when upgraded).

Command: electronic warfare/support. More computer slots (and even more when upgraded) + higher base energy than Interceptor/Assault of comparable size.

Multi-Role: flexible baseline; balanced slots/stats.

Upgrade principle: Each base frame has an Advanced version with (a) modestly improved core stats, (b) +1–2 relevant slots based on role rule above, and (c) slightly higher energy (all roles), with Command receiving the highest energy uplift.

2) Spec Model (what every ship must define)

Identity

Class (Strike/Escort/Line/Capital), Role, Level requirement, Faction counterpart, Upgrade path.

Economy

Purchase cost (currency: e.g., cubits or tylium; include merits if applicable).

Upgrade cost (to Advanced): currency + gated level.

Operating costs: boost drain (Tyl/s), FTL cost (Tyl/LY).

Equipment Slots (by family)

Weapons (or Gun/Launcher/Defensive for Capitals), Hull, Engine, Computer, optional Utility.

Hull Systems (survivability)

Hull Points, Hull Recovery (/s), Durability, Armor, Critical Defense.

Engine Systems (mobility)

Avoidance, Turning Speed (deg/s), Turning Acceleration (deg/s²), Inertial Compensation (m/s), Linear Acceleration (m/s²), Cruise Speed (m/s), Boost Speed (m/s), Boost Cost (Tyl/s).

FTL Systems

Range (LY), Charge (s), Threat Charge (optional, s), Cost (Tyl/LY).

Computer Systems (energy/sensors)

Power (capacity), Power Recharge (/s), Firewall Rating (defensive EW), Emitter Rating (offensive EW), DRADIS Range (m), Visual Range (m).

Notes

Firing-arc characteristics (e.g., nearly 360° arrays on certain escorts), weak-spot coverage, role bonuses (e.g., command bonus to FTL transponder power cost).

3) How Specs Behave In-Game (implementation formulas & behaviors)

Textual formulas only—express them clearly for the LLM to implement.

3.1 Survivability & Damage

Hit resolution: Attacker Accuracy − Defender Avoidance → clamp to [0,1] as hit chance.

Crit: (Base Crit + Attacker bonus − Defender Critical Defense) → on hit, apply Crit Multiplier.

Armor: Reduce incoming damage by Armor value but enforce a penetration floor (e.g., at least 15% of pre-armor damage always goes through) to prevent total nullification.

Hull Recovery: Regenerates per second; pause briefly after taking damage unless a module overrides.

Durability: Long-term integrity; heavy collision and sustained hits reduce Durability alongside hull.

3.2 Movement

Throttle/Boost: Target speed is Cruise or Boost; approach using Acceleration.

Turning: Apply Turning Speed as cap, Turning Acceleration as responsiveness.

Inertial Compensation: Gradually realign actual velocity vector with ship forward; lower values = more drift.

Strafing (if supported): Cap lateral/vertical speed; scale to size class.

3.3 Energy Economy

Power Capacity/Recharge feed all energy-using actions (weapons, PD, ECM/ECCM, boost if designed that way).

Command ships: higher baselines; Advanced variants add a further margin.

3.4 Sensors & Targeting

DRADIS Range determines detection radius; Visual Range gates close-in identification.

Lock-on advances when target remains in arc, range, and LOS; decays when broken.

EW: Firewall defends vs. jams/hacks; Emitter increases offensive EW; Command frames get bonuses.

3.5 Weapons & Arcs

Gimbal limits per hardpoint define firing cone; outside cone, mount cannot track.

Hitscan: roll accuracy vs avoidance;

Projectile/Missile: compute lead solution; missiles require/benefit from target lock; PD/defensive weapons can intercept.

Heavy escorts/lines may mount side/ dorsal batteries to widen coverage; Glaive-like escorts can approach near-360° coverage via head/circumferential mounts (documented as a frame trait).

3.6 FTL

Jump allowed if distance ≤ Range and ship pays Cost = (Tyl/LY) × distance;

Charge time applies (use “Threat Charge” when recently in combat);

Transponder/Command bonus: reduce transponder power cost on Command frames; Advanced Command reduces further.

4) Role-Based Slot & Energy Rules (applies to base → Advanced)

Interceptor (any size):

Base: +1 Engine slot relative to role-neutral baseline for that size.

Advanced: +1 additional Engine slot (total +2 vs baseline).

Energy: +small upgrade (enough to sustain extra engine/boost modules).

Assault:

Base: +1 Hull slot vs baseline.

Advanced: +1 additional Hull slot (total +2 vs baseline).

Energy: +small-to-moderate upgrade (support heavier armor/regen modules).

Command:

Base: +2 Computer slots vs baseline (Escorts) or +1 vs baseline (Lines), choose consistent policy and apply across sizes.

Advanced: +1 additional Computer slot (aggregate advantage persists).

Energy: highest baseline within class; Advanced adds the largest energy uplift.

(You can tune the exact deltas, but keep the relationship consistent so identity is clear.)

5) Economy & Progression

Currencies: Cubits (premium), Tylium (fuel/soft currency), Merits (rank/rep).

Costs:

Purchase Cost per frame (can be cubits or tylium; capitals may need both + merits).

Upgrade Cost to Advanced (same currency family, scaled 1.3–1.8× plus level gate).

Operating: Boost Cost (Tyl/s), FTL Cost (Tyl/LY).

Pre-installed Systems: Ship may spawn with starter weapons (e.g., 2 light autocannons on Viper Mk VII).

Role Bonuses: e.g., Command reduces FTL transponder power cost; Advanced Command increases the reduction.

6) Implementation Workflow (data-driven—no code required here)

Author a canonical spec sheet per ship with all fields in §2.

Validate units (m, m/s, s, LY) and currencies.

Derive role-based slot counts & energy from the class baseline using §4.

Define weapon arcs: per hardpoint gimbal; note special traits (e.g., Glaive’s near-360° coverage).

Attach economy: purchase/upgrade/operating costs; pre-installed starter items.

QA checklist:

Time-to-kill within target bands vs peers.

Boost/energy sustainability (≥8–10 s under typical loadouts).

FTL range/cost feels right for its tier.

Sensors/lock and PD feel fair relative to role.

Advanced frames provide clear, not runaway, improvements.

Advanced upgrade: modest increases across survivability/energy; possibly +1 defensive slot or improved role auras.

Play: mobile base and objective pivot; never solo—operates with fleet screen.

8) Example Data Sheets (how to author them—textual)

For each ship, capture exactly these sections so your LLM can serialize them into data later.

Header: Name; Level Req; Class; Role; Counterpart; Purchase Cost; Upgrade To.

Slots: list counts by family (and weapon subfamilies for Capitals).

Hull Systems: HP, Regen/s, Durability, Armor, Critical Defense.

Engine Systems: Avoidance; Turn; Turn Accel; Inertial Comp; Accel; Speed; Boost; Boost Cost.

FTL Systems: Range; Charge; (Threat Charge if used); Cost per LY.

Computer Systems: Power; Recharge; Firewall; Emitter; DRADIS Range; Visual Range.

Role Bonuses & Traits: e.g., command transponder discount; near-360° arcs; weak spots.

Pre-installed Systems: specify starter weapons/modules.

Economy Notes: where to purchase; currency mix; upgrade gate.

(Populate the four exemplars with the exact values you provided.)

9) Balance Guardrails

TTK targets: 8–14 s for equal-tier duels (Strike vs Strike, Escort vs Escort, etc.).

Energy: baseline build must sustain continuous fire + maneuver for ≥8 s; Advanced +15–25%.

Mobility ladders: Strike > Escort > Line > Capital; never let an Escort turn faster than your fastest Strike.

Sensor ladders: Line/Capital DRADIS ≥ Escort ≥ Strike; Visual increases with size only slightly.

FTL ladders: larger hulls tend to longer range and steeper cost; Command gets transponder discounts.

Slot identity: Enforce role slot deltas rigorously so identity is unmistakable.

10) Feature Notes Specific to Your Examples (to encode as traits)

Viper Mk VII (Strike/Multi-Role): balanced slot spread for a strike; common fleet pick; PD/missile denial competency when built for it.

Glaive (Escort/Command): 5 computer slots base; near-360° coverage from its head ring; underside vulnerability; rolling to defend belly; high power & recharge for an Escort.

Vanir (Line/Command): heavy command with high energy and computer count; missile-boat viable with energy builds; unique twin-hull silhouette is cosmetic (collision like other Lines).

Brimir (Capital/Carrier): distinct weapon slot families; Outpost Mode, jump beacon, strike docking (up to a squad size); repair/rearm aura; large energy pool.

11) QA & Acceptance Checklist (per ship)

Spec sheet is complete and consistent with class/role rules.

Arcs/gimbals match the frame’s intended coverage.

Economy numbers align with tier (purchase, upgrade, operating).

Role bonus (if any) is active and visible (e.g., Command transponder discount).

Pre-installs appear correctly on first spawn.

Advanced variant: added slots and stat upticks adhere to §4 (Engine/Hull/Computer by role) and energy increases accordingly.

Outposts (stations, system control, sentry networks, services)
1) Concept & role

Outposts are stationary battle stations that function as the hub of a star system: they enable docking, refit/repair, resource management, and (at certain control levels) act as FTL jump beacons. Each faction can field an Outpost in a system; if both are present, the sector map displays a split ring (half blue/half red). On the system map, show the station icon; on the sector map, render a red or blue circle (split when both factions are present).

Outposts exist in three strength tiers:

Regular — base hull 50,000

Upgraded — base hull 55,000

Fortified — base hull 60,000

The tier and the number/weight of Sentry Platforms around an Outpost are determined by System Control Level, which is driven by Outpost Progress % in that system.

2) System control & Outpost Progress
2.1 Progress scale & visibility

Progress value: 0% … 300% (cap at 300%).

UI: show a persistent “Outpost progress” widget (top-left), with current System Control Level (0–10) derived from the progress value.

2.2 How progress increases (player/system activity)

Increase progress by any of the following activities performed by the owning faction in that system:

Mining (individual and via Mining Ships)

PVE (killing NPCs)

PVP (killing enemy players)

Freighter in Distress mission success

Drone Incursion (Nexus) mission success

Penalty: an unsuccessful Freighter in Distress mission subtracts 15% from the progress counter.

2.3 Auto-drain & retreat

Auto-drain: progress decreases per minute when player activity subsides (make the drain rate a tunable).

Retreat threshold: if progress drops below 90%, any active Outpost jumps out (despawns from the system).

2.4 Destruction & repair timer

If an Outpost is destroyed, it leaves the system. The owning faction’s progress UI replaces the percent with a Repair Timer set to 60 minutes.

During repair countdown, players can still contribute to progress by doing the activities above. When the timer expires:

If accumulated progress corresponds to Control Level ≥ 2 (≥90%), the progress resumes from that level (and the Outpost will re-enter per the level rules below).

Otherwise, resume normal progress at the achieved number and wait for re-entry conditions to be met.

2.5 Control levels & what they unlock

Map progress to levels and station capabilities:

Level	Progress	Station Change / Unlocks
1	50%	System “captured” by a faction. No Outpost yet.
2	90%	Regular Outpost enters system.
3	125%	Outpost gains FTL Jump Beacon + 2 Light Sentry Platforms.
4	175%	+2 more Light Sentry Platforms (total 4 Light).
5	200%	Outpost upgrades to Upgraded; 2 Light → 2 Medium (net: 2 Light + 2 Medium).
6	225%	Remaining 2 Light → 2 Medium (net: 4 Medium).
7	250%	2 Medium → 2 Heavy (net: 2 Medium + 2 Heavy).
8	275%	Outpost upgrades to Fortified; remaining 2 Medium → 2 Heavy (net: 4 Heavy).
9–10	300%	No further changes (capstone stability).

Both factions can have Outposts in the same system when their respective progress/levels warrant it. The sector ring becomes a split color.

3) Sentry Platforms (defensive perimeter)

Purpose: add graduated firepower and area denial around the Outpost based on the current control level.

Placement: spawn platforms at equal angular intervals on a ring around the Outpost at a fixed radius (tunable), with line-of-fire overlap but no occlusion of the dock bay.

Categories & given stats:

Light Sentry Platform

Hull: 7,500

Energy: 3,000

Armor: 35

Armament: 8 × 20 mm autocannon turrets, 2 × Interceptor Missile Launchers

Medium Sentry Platform

Hull: 10,000

Energy: 3,000

Armor: 60

Armament: 8 × 127 mm autocannon turrets, 5 × Medium Missile Launchers

Heavy Sentry Platform

Stats not provided in your brief. Define as a tunable upgrade over Medium (greater hull/armor/energy and heavier weapons). Document values explicitly when you decide them.

Behavior:

Platforms are immobile, inherit faction allegiance and IFF.

Targeting priorities: missiles → strike craft → escorts → lines → capitals (tunable).

Power economy: weapons consume platform energy; platforms pause fire to recharge if depleted.

Respawn: no auto-respawn during the same Outpost life; they’re recreated when the Outpost re-enters at the appropriate level.

4) Station services & docking
4.1 Docking mechanics

Docking radius: use your game’s standard (e.g., ≤ 800–1000 m) for interact prompts.

Flow: slow to docking speed → press Interact → fade to Outpost Interior scene (faction-specific).

Collision: dock entry corridor is non-combat; disable weapons once docking begins.

4.2 Services available inside

Fitting / Equipment Management: swap ship modules and weapons by slot family; validate power and slot constraints.

Repairs & Recharge:

Repair Hull (instant in bay) and Durability (consumes Titanium or credits).

Recharge Power pool instantly; refill ammo/missiles.

Resource Banking & Trade: deposit Tylium, Titanium, Water; exchange consistent with your economy rules.

Mission Board: accept Freighter in Distress, Drone Incursion, contracts, etc.

Spawn/Respawn Point: player can set Outpost as local respawn.

FTL Beacon Access: if the Outpost has a beacon (Control Level ≥ 3), show Jump-to-Outpost/Jump-from-Outpost options subject to rules below.

4.3 FTL beacon behavior

Unlock level: from Level 3 upward.

Jump-to-Outpost: allies can FTL to the Outpost if (a) they are not interdicted, (b) pay per-LY cost, (c) within their ship’s FTL range or you decide to allow beacon as a destination outside ship range (design choice; carriers often enabled global jumps—decide and document).

Jump-from-Outpost: standard ship FTL rules apply (range/cost/charge).

Interdiction: enemy jammers near the Outpost can delay or block inbound/outbound jumps (tunable radius/time).

5) Ownership, UI, and map representation

Ownership: store owner_faction per Outpost instance; when destroyed or retreated, set owner_faction = None.

Sector map ring: draw a blue or red ring at system node; draw split ring if both factions have Outposts.

System map icon: station glyph with a tier badge (Regular/Upgraded/Fortified) and a small counter of active platforms (L/M/H).

HUD cues: broadcast faction-colored homing marker and distance in meters when Outpost exists.

6) State machine (no code—behavioral blueprint)

States

Absent (no Outpost)

Spooling (progress at/above threshold, jump-in pending)

Deployed: Regular / Upgraded / Fortified

Retreating (progress fell below 90% or hull reached 0 → jump-out)

Repair Countdown (60 min), with progress accumulation active

Transitions

Absent → Spooling when progress ≥ 90%

Spooling → Deployed(Regular) enter sequence & spawn perimeter platforms per current level

Deployed(Regular/Upgraded/Fortified) → Retreating when progress < 90% OR hull ≤ 0

Retreating → Repair Countdown (if destroyed) or Retreating → Absent (if progress fell)

Repair Countdown → Absent when timer ends but progress < 90%

Repair Countdown → Spooling when timer ends and progress ≥ 90% (resume at achieved level)

7) Combat interactions & objectives

Attack/defense: Outposts and platforms engage hostiles automatically; attackers can force retreat by destroying the Outpost, which also triggers the 60-minute repair timer.

PVP/PVE hooks: killing enemies near the Outpost contributes to progress (for defenders) or stalls it (for attackers) per your contribution rules.

Objective UI: when the Outpost is present, show an objective card with hull %, tier, platform status, and whether the FTL beacon is online.

8) Tuning & fairness guidelines

Platform DPS: set to deter lone attackers but not to erase full fleets; scale with level (Light < Medium < Heavy).

Auto-drain: choose a value that empties a quiet system back below 90% within a reasonable window (e.g., tens of minutes) to keep the galaxy dynamic.

Beacon power: powerful, but keep interdiction counters viable.

Progress sources: weight group activities (Freighters/Drone Incursions) slightly higher than solo mining so systems with coordinated play upgrade faster.

Spawn radius: position platforms so defenders can reach the fight, but attackers can also maneuver around blind sectors.

9) Data you must define (per Outpost & per Platform)

Outpost

Faction, System ID, Position

Tier (Regular/Upgraded/Fortified)

Hull HP (per tier), Armor, Regen (if any)

Control Level (derived) and Progress %

Auto-drain rate (%/min)

Repair Timer remaining (if any)

Beacon enabled (bool)

Platform layout (ring radius, count by category)

Services enabled (booleans)

Sentry Platform (by category)

Hull, Armor, Energy, Recharge (if applicable)

Weapons package (counts & types)

Target priorities & engagement range

Spawn transform relative to Outpost (radius, angle)

Faction IFF

Heavy Platform: stats not provided—fill these as a deliberate design pass and document them before implementation.

10) Test scenarios (acceptance)

Progress build-up: perform mining/PVE/PVP until 90% → Outpost jumps in at Level 2; verify tier = Regular.

Level ups: continue to 125%, 175%, 200%, 225%, 250%, 275% → verify beacon and platform upgrades exactly match the table.

Auto-drain: leave system idle until progress < 90% → Outpost retreats.

Destruction: kill a Level-N Outpost → immediate retreat; 60-minute repair timer starts; continue contributing; after timer, ensure re-entry at the correct level.

Dual presence: both factions cross thresholds → both Outposts present; sector ring splits correctly.

Beacon: at Level ≥ 3, jump to/from Outpost; verify interdiction correctly blocks/delays.

Services: dock and use fit/repair/rearm/bank; verify costs and constraints.

Platform scaling: platform composition and stats match level; no respawn until station cycles.
