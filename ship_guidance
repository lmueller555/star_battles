Ship Classes, Roles, Specs, and Implementation Rules (with Stats Library)
1) Taxonomy & Identity
1.1 Size Classes

Strike (Light): small silhouette, high agility, low armor/hull.

Escort (Medium): balanced mobility/survivability, more hardpoints.

Line (Heavy): tanky, slow turn/accel, heavy weapon arrays.

Capital (XL): carriers/battlestars; distinct weapon slot families (Guns / Launchers / Defensive), logistics/respawn roles.

1.2 Combat Roles

Interceptor: speed/agility specialists. +Engine slots (even more on Advanced).

Assault: frontline brawler/tank. +Hull slots (even more on Advanced).

Command: electronic warfare/support. +Computer slots (even more on Advanced) and the highest energy within size class.

Multi-Role: flexible baseline; balanced slots/stats.

Advanced Variants: Every base frame has an Advanced version with (a) modest core-stat increases, (b) +1 to the role’s signature slot family (Command: Computer; Interceptor: Engine; Assault: Hull), and (c) extra Power Capacity/Recharge to sustain the added slots.

2) Spec Model (what every ship must define)
2.1 Identity

name, level_requirement, faction_counterpart, class (Strike/Escort/Line/Capital), role (Interceptor/Assault/Command/Multi-Role), upgrade_to (Advanced …).

2.2 Economy

Purchase Cost: currency mix (Cubits, Tylium, Merits).

Upgrade Cost (to Advanced): currency + level gate.

Operating: Boost Cost (Tylium/sec), FTL Cost (Tylium/LY).

2.3 Equipment Slots (by family)

Strike/Escort/Line: weapons, hull, engine, computer.

Capital: guns, launchers, defensive_weapons, plus hull, engine, computer.

Optional: utility/special if your design needs it.

2.4 Hull Systems (survivability)

Hull Points (HP)

Hull Recovery (HP/sec)

Durability (structural integrity; reduces under heavy stress)

Armor Value (flat damage reduction / penetration check)

Critical Defense (reduces attacker crit chance/efficacy)

2.5 Engine Systems (mobility)

Speed (m/s), Boost Speed (m/s), Boost Cost (Tylium/sec)

Acceleration (m/s²), Boost Acceleration (m/s²)

Turning Speeds: Pitch/Yaw/Roll Speed (deg/s)

Turning Accelerations: Pitch/Yaw/Roll Accel (deg/s²)

Inertial Compensation (m/s; how quickly lateral drift is auto-trimmed)

Strafe Speed/Acceleration (if enabled)

Avoidance (evasiveness vs. incoming accuracy)

Avoidance Fading (rate at which avoidance bonus decays while under fire)

2.6 FTL Systems

FTL Range (LY)

FTL Charge Time (s)

FTL Cooldown (s)

FTL Cost (Tylium/LY unless explicitly defined otherwise)

2.7 Computer/Energy & Sensors

Power Points (capacity)

Power Recovery (per second)

Firewall Rating (defensive EW)

Emitter Rating (offensive EW)

Base DRADIS Range (m), Maximum DRADIS Range (m)

Visual Range (m)

2.8 Environmental

Max Radiation Level (threshold)

Radioactive Decay (rate)

Radioresistance (modifier)

Unit discipline:
Distances in meters (m); speeds in m/s; linear acceleration in m/s²; angular rates in deg/s and deg/s²; FTL distance in light-years (LY); time in seconds (s); energy points for capacity; currency in Tylium/Cubits/Merits.

3) How Specs Behave In-Game (clear formulas & behaviors)
3.1 Survivability & Damage

Hit chance: hit = clamp01( (AttackerAccuracy − DefenderAvoidance) / scale ) (choose a scale that yields sensible mid-tier hit rates).

Critical: (BaseCrit + AttackerCrit − DefenderCriticalDefense); on hit, apply crit multiplier.

Armor: reduce incoming damage by ArmorValue after penetration checks; enforce a minimum-throughput floor (e.g., ≥15%) so damage never fully zeros out.

Hull Recovery: heal HullRecovery per second out of combat (or per your rules).

Durability: long-term HP; collision and sustained damage can reduce it; repairable at stations.

3.2 Movement

Speed control: approach target speed using Acceleration; when Boosting, use Boost Acceleration and consume Boost Cost.

Turning: cap with Pitch/Yaw/Roll Speed, adjust responsiveness via corresponding Accelerations.

Inertial Compensation: steer velocity vector toward forward direction over time; higher = snappier, lower = more drift.

Avoidance Fading: while targeted/under fire, decay avoidance at rate AvoidanceFading toward a floor; recover when not under fire.

3.3 Energy/Sensors

Power Points (capacity) + Power Recovery (regen) feed weapons, PD, ECM/ECCM, and any energy-using flight aids (if applicable).

DRADIS: detects contacts up to Base; skills/modules can push to Maximum temporarily.

Visual Range: proximity at which you get full target detail/ID.

Firewall/Emitter: defensive vs offensive EW contests.

3.4 Weapons/Arcs

Each mount has a gimbal cone; can only track within that cone.

Hitscan: roll hit vs target Avoidance.

Projectile/Missile: compute lead; missiles may need lock; PD can intercept.

Frame traits can broaden coverage (e.g., escorts with near-360° head arrays).

3.5 FTL

Eligibility: distance ≤ FTL Range; not interdicted; energy/cost available.

Cost: (FTL Cost) × distance (LY) unless the ship’s sheet defines a different rule.

Charge/Cooldown: enforce both Charge Time and Cooldown timers.

4) Role-Based Slot & Energy Rules (base → Advanced)

Interceptor: Base +1 Engine vs size baseline; Advanced +1 more Engine (total +2 vs baseline). Modest Power/Recovery bump.

Assault: Base +1 Hull; Advanced +1 more Hull (total +2). Small–moderate Power bump.

Command: Base +Computer advantage (e.g., +2 for Escorts, +1 for Lines; choose and stay consistent); Advanced +1 more Computer. Highest Power/Recovery within size class.

5) Economy & Progression

Currencies: Cubits (premium), Tylium (fuel/soft), Merits (rank/rep).

Purchase/Upgrade costs are per-frame; Operating includes Boost drain and FTL cost.

Pre-installed systems: list the exact starter equipment (weapons/modules) a frame spawns with.

6) Implementation Workflow (data-driven)

Author a spec sheet per ship using §2 fields (exact names/units).

Validate slot counts with §4 role rules.

Define weapon arcs/gimbals per mount; document any frame trait (e.g., broad coverage rings).

Attach economy (purchase/upgrade/operating) and pre-installs.

QA with the checklist in §11.

7) Class Playbooks (feel targets)

Strike / Multi-Role: crisp accel/turn; survivability built on Avoidance + smart armor.

Escort / Command: broad firing coverage, EW utility; needs escort vs. fast strikes.

Line / Command: anchor and area control; missile/energy builds viable; relies on screen.

Capital / Carrier: logistics, respawn, area buffs; “Outpost mode”-like role powers if implemented.

8) Stats Library (authoritative per-ship numbers)

This section is the single source of truth for concrete stats. Add a new subsection for each ship you share. Do not invent values—only record those provided. Use units exactly as defined in §2.

Notes & open items

Values tagged [verify] looked ambiguous on the screenshot; please confirm numerically (we’ll update the sheet verbatim).

If this frame’s slot counts differ in this UI, paste that panel and we’ll replace the placeholder counts.

When you share the Advanced Viper Mk VII, add a sibling entry “Viper Mk VII (Advanced)” with only the fields that change (slot deltas, Power/Recovery increase, etc.) to avoid duplication.

9) Balance Guardrails (unchanged, restated for reference)

TTK targets: 8–14 s for equal-tier duels within a class.

Energy sustain: baseline builds sustain ≥8–10 s of continuous fire + maneuver; Advanced +15–25%.

Mobility ladder: Strike > Escort > Line > Capital (turn rates & accel).

Sensor ladder: DRADIS increases with size; Visual only slightly.

FTL ladder: larger hulls tend to more range and higher cost; Command frames may discount transponder costs.

Slot identity: Enforce role slot advantages rigorously.

10) Feature Notes Specific to Named Frames (context for coders)

Viper Mk VII (Strike/Multi-Role): balanced strike with reliable PD/missile denial when fitted; excels in angles; survivability via Avoidance + modest Armor.

(Examples retained for future entries:) Glaive (Escort/Command), Vanir (Line/Command), Brimir (Capital/Carrier)—add their concrete stat sheets under Stats Library as you provide them.

11) QA & Acceptance Checklist (per ship)

Spec sheet complete and unit-correct (no missing fields; no invented numbers).

Slots obey §4 role rules; Advanced variant shows correct deltas.

Arcs/gimbals defined per mount; any frame trait documented.

Economy (purchase/upgrade/operating) present and coherent.

Pre-installs spawn correctly.

Movement & energy behavior matches numbers (e.g., measured Boost Speed ≤ configured value).

Sensors/lock feel consistent with DRADIS/Visual numbers.

FTL respects range/charge/cost; cooldown enforced.
