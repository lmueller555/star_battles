Ship Classes, Roles, Specs, and Implementation Rules
1) Taxonomy & Identity
1.1 Size Classes

Strike (Light): small silhouette, high agility, low armor/hull.

Escort (Medium): balanced mobility/survivability, more hardpoints.

Line (Heavy): tanky, slow turn/accel, heavy weapon arrays.

Capital (XL): carriers/battlestars; special slot families (guns, launchers, defensive weapons), logistics/respawn roles.

1.2 Combat Roles

Interceptor: speed/agility specialists. More engine slots (and even more when upgraded).

Assault: frontline brawler/tank. More hull slots (and even more when upgraded).

Command: electronic warfare/support. More computer slots (and even more when upgraded) + higher base energy than Interceptor/Assault of comparable size.

Multi-Role: flexible baseline; balanced slots/stats.

Upgrade principle: Each base frame has an Advanced version with (a) modestly improved core stats, (b) +1–2 relevant slots based on role rule above, and (c) slightly higher energy (all roles), with Command receiving the highest energy uplift.

2) Spec Model (what every ship must define)

Identity

Class (Strike/Escort/Line/Capital), Role, Level requirement, Faction counterpart, Upgrade path.

Economy

Purchase cost (currency: e.g., cubits or tylium; include merits if applicable).

Upgrade cost (to Advanced): currency + gated level.

Operating costs: boost drain (Tyl/s), FTL cost (Tyl/LY).

Equipment Slots (by family)

Weapons (or Gun/Launcher/Defensive for Capitals), Hull, Engine, Computer, optional Utility.

Hull Systems (survivability)

Hull Points, Hull Recovery (/s), Durability, Armor, Critical Defense.

Engine Systems (mobility)

Avoidance, Turning Speed (deg/s), Turning Acceleration (deg/s²), Inertial Compensation (m/s), Linear Acceleration (m/s²), Cruise Speed (m/s), Boost Speed (m/s), Boost Cost (Tyl/s).

FTL Systems

Range (LY), Charge (s), Threat Charge (optional, s), Cost (Tyl/LY).

Computer Systems (energy/sensors)

Power (capacity), Power Recharge (/s), Firewall Rating (defensive EW), Emitter Rating (offensive EW), DRADIS Range (m), Visual Range (m).

Notes

Firing-arc characteristics (e.g., nearly 360° arrays on certain escorts), weak-spot coverage, role bonuses (e.g., command bonus to FTL transponder power cost).

3) How Specs Behave In-Game (implementation formulas & behaviors)

Textual formulas only—express them clearly for the LLM to implement.

3.1 Survivability & Damage

Hit resolution: Attacker Accuracy − Defender Avoidance → clamp to [0,1] as hit chance.

Crit: (Base Crit + Attacker bonus − Defender Critical Defense) → on hit, apply Crit Multiplier.

Armor: Reduce incoming damage by Armor value but enforce a penetration floor (e.g., at least 15% of pre-armor damage always goes through) to prevent total nullification.

Hull Recovery: Regenerates per second; pause briefly after taking damage unless a module overrides.

Durability: Long-term integrity; heavy collision and sustained hits reduce Durability alongside hull.

3.2 Movement

Throttle/Boost: Target speed is Cruise or Boost; approach using Acceleration.

Turning: Apply Turning Speed as cap, Turning Acceleration as responsiveness.

Inertial Compensation: Gradually realign actual velocity vector with ship forward; lower values = more drift.

Strafing (if supported): Cap lateral/vertical speed; scale to size class.

3.3 Energy Economy

Power Capacity/Recharge feed all energy-using actions (weapons, PD, ECM/ECCM, boost if designed that way).

Command ships: higher baselines; Advanced variants add a further margin.

3.4 Sensors & Targeting

DRADIS Range determines detection radius; Visual Range gates close-in identification.

Lock-on advances when target remains in arc, range, and LOS; decays when broken.

EW: Firewall defends vs. jams/hacks; Emitter increases offensive EW; Command frames get bonuses.

3.5 Weapons & Arcs

Gimbal limits per hardpoint define firing cone; outside cone, mount cannot track.

Hitscan: roll accuracy vs avoidance;

Projectile/Missile: compute lead solution; missiles require/benefit from target lock; PD/defensive weapons can intercept.

Heavy escorts/lines may mount side/ dorsal batteries to widen coverage; Glaive-like escorts can approach near-360° coverage via head/circumferential mounts (documented as a frame trait).

3.6 FTL

Jump allowed if distance ≤ Range and ship pays Cost = (Tyl/LY) × distance;

Charge time applies (use “Threat Charge” when recently in combat);

Transponder/Command bonus: reduce transponder power cost on Command frames; Advanced Command reduces further.

4) Role-Based Slot & Energy Rules (applies to base → Advanced)

Interceptor (any size):

Base: +1 Engine slot relative to role-neutral baseline for that size.

Advanced: +1 additional Engine slot (total +2 vs baseline).

Energy: +small upgrade (enough to sustain extra engine/boost modules).

Assault:

Base: +1 Hull slot vs baseline.

Advanced: +1 additional Hull slot (total +2 vs baseline).

Energy: +small-to-moderate upgrade (support heavier armor/regen modules).

Command:

Base: +2 Computer slots vs baseline (Escorts) or +1 vs baseline (Lines), choose consistent policy and apply across sizes.

Advanced: +1 additional Computer slot (aggregate advantage persists).

Energy: highest baseline within class; Advanced adds the largest energy uplift.

(You can tune the exact deltas, but keep the relationship consistent so identity is clear.)

5) Economy & Progression

Currencies: Cubits (premium), Tylium (fuel/soft currency), Merits (rank/rep).

Costs:

Purchase Cost per frame (can be cubits or tylium; capitals may need both + merits).

Upgrade Cost to Advanced (same currency family, scaled 1.3–1.8× plus level gate).

Operating: Boost Cost (Tyl/s), FTL Cost (Tyl/LY).

Pre-installed Systems: Ship may spawn with starter weapons (e.g., 2 light autocannons on Viper Mk VII).

Role Bonuses: e.g., Command reduces FTL transponder power cost; Advanced Command increases the reduction.

6) Implementation Workflow (data-driven—no code required here)

Author a canonical spec sheet per ship with all fields in §2.

Validate units (m, m/s, s, LY) and currencies.

Derive role-based slot counts & energy from the class baseline using §4.

Define weapon arcs: per hardpoint gimbal; note special traits (e.g., Glaive’s near-360° coverage).

Attach economy: purchase/upgrade/operating costs; pre-installed starter items.

QA checklist:

Time-to-kill within target bands vs peers.

Boost/energy sustainability (≥8–10 s under typical loadouts).

FTL range/cost feels right for its tier.

Sensors/lock and PD feel fair relative to role.

Advanced frames provide clear, not runaway, improvements.

Role abilities: Outpost Mode (immobile fortress + jump beacon), faction-wide jump-to-carrier, area buffs, repair/rearm aura, strike docking.

Advanced upgrade: modest increases across survivability/energy; possibly +1 defensive slot or improved role auras.

Play: mobile base and objective pivot; never solo—operates with fleet screen.

8) Example Data Sheets (how to author them—textual)

For each ship, capture exactly these sections so your LLM can serialize them into data later.

Header: Name; Level Req; Class; Role; Counterpart; Purchase Cost; Upgrade To.

Slots: list counts by family (and weapon subfamilies for Capitals).

Hull Systems: HP, Regen/s, Durability, Armor, Critical Defense.

Engine Systems: Avoidance; Turn; Turn Accel; Inertial Comp; Accel; Speed; Boost; Boost Cost.

FTL Systems: Range; Charge; (Threat Charge if used); Cost per LY.

Computer Systems: Power; Recharge; Firewall; Emitter; DRADIS Range; Visual Range.

Role Bonuses & Traits: e.g., command transponder discount; near-360° arcs; weak spots.

Pre-installed Systems: specify starter weapons/modules.

Economy Notes: where to purchase; currency mix; upgrade gate.

(Populate the four exemplars with the exact values you provided.)

9) Balance Guardrails

TTK targets: 8–14 s for equal-tier duels (Strike vs Strike, Escort vs Escort, etc.).

Energy: baseline build must sustain continuous fire + maneuver for ≥8 s; Advanced +15–25%.

Mobility ladders: Strike > Escort > Line > Capital; never let an Escort turn faster than your fastest Strike.

Sensor ladders: Line/Capital DRADIS ≥ Escort ≥ Strike; Visual increases with size only slightly.

FTL ladders: larger hulls tend to longer range and steeper cost; Command gets transponder discounts.

Slot identity: Enforce role slot deltas rigorously so identity is unmistakable.

10) Feature Notes Specific to Your Examples (to encode as traits)

Viper Mk VII (Strike/Multi-Role): balanced slot spread for a strike; common fleet pick; PD/missile denial competency when built for it.

Glaive (Escort/Command): 5 computer slots base; near-360° coverage from its head ring; underside vulnerability; rolling to defend belly; high power & recharge for an Escort.

Vanir (Line/Command): heavy command with high energy and computer count; missile-boat viable with energy builds; unique twin-hull silhouette is cosmetic (collision like other Lines).

Brimir (Capital/Carrier): distinct weapon slot families; Outpost Mode, jump beacon, strike docking (up to a squad size); repair/rearm aura; large energy pool.

11) QA & Acceptance Checklist (per ship)

Spec sheet is complete and consistent with class/role rules.

Arcs/gimbals match the frame’s intended coverage.

Economy numbers align with tier (purchase, upgrade, operating).

Role bonus (if any) is active and visible (e.g., Command transponder discount).

Pre-installs appear correctly on first spawn.

Advanced variant: added slots and stat upticks adhere to §4 (Engine/Hull/Computer by role) and energy increases accordingly.
