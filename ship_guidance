SHIP_GUIDANCE (Scalable Edition — with Upgradeable Stat Model)
A) Global Rules (apply to every ship)

Size classes: Strike (light) • Escort (medium) • Line (heavy) • Capital (XL).
Roles: Interceptor (extra Engine slots), Assault (extra Hull slots), Command (extra Computer slots + highest energy), Multi-Role (balanced).
Advanced variants: Each base hull has an Advanced version with modest stat bumps, +1 in its role’s signature slot family (Command: Computer; Interceptor: Engine; Assault: Hull), and extra Power Capacity/Recovery to sustain added modules.

A.1 Canonical Spec Fields & Units

These fields appear on the in-game ship panel. Record exact values and mark any upgradeable fields with a base value and a delta (the blue number on your panel).

Identity

name, class (Strike/Escort/Line/Capital), role, level_requirement, faction_counterpart, upgrade_to (Advanced …).

Economy

purchase_cost (currency), upgrade_cost (to Advanced), operating: boost_cost (Tylium/sec), ftl_cost (Tylium/LY or as displayed).

Equipment Slots (all families listed for consistency; use 0 when unsupported)

Strike/Escort/Line: weapons, hull, engine, computer.

Weapon subfamilies (if UI shows them): gun, launcher, defensive_weapon, special_weapon.

Capital: guns, launchers, defensive_weapons + hull, engine, computer.

When the panel shows counts like “4(+1)”, store:

base: 4

advanced_delta: +1

advanced_total: 5

Hull / Survivability

hull_points, hull_recovery_per_sec, durability, armor_value, critical_defense.

Engine / Mobility

Linear: speed (m/s), boost_speed (m/s), acceleration (m/s²), boost_acceleration (m/s²), boost_cost (Tyl/s).

Angular: turning_speed (deg/s) (or per-axis), turning_acceleration (deg/s²) (or pitch/yaw/roll speed & accel if available), roll_speed, roll_acceleration.

Handling: inertial_compensation (m/s), strafe_speed, strafe_acceleration.

Evasion: avoidance, avoidance_fading.

FTL

ftl_range (LY), ftl_charge_time (s), ftl_cooldown (s), ftl_cost (Tylium/LY), optional transponder_power_cost.

Energy & Sensors / EW

power_points (capacity), power_recovery_per_sec, firewall_rating, emitter_rating, dradis_range_base (m), dradis_range_max (m), visual_range (m).

Environmental

max_radiation_level, radioactive_decay, radioresistance.

Notes

Frame traits (e.g., wide firing arcs), role bonuses (e.g., transponder discounts), pre-installed systems.

A.2 Upgradeable Fields (from the blue stats on your panel)

Fields that can show a blue delta (meaning the Advanced variant increases them):

Slots: weapons, engine, sometimes others (UI shows the + in parentheses)

Hull: hull_points, hull_recovery_per_sec, durability

Mobility: turning_speed, acceleration, speed, boost_speed

Energy: power_points
(If other fields display in blue on other frames, add them as upgradeable for those ships.)

Recording convention: For any upgradeable field, store base, advanced_delta, and advanced_total = base + advanced_delta. Do not invent deltas—only use the UI numbers.

A.3 Behavioral Formulas (text only)

Hit chance: hit = clamp01( (AttackerAccuracy − DefenderAvoidance) / scale ).

Critical: critChance = clamp01(BaseCrit + AttackerCrit − DefenderCriticalDefense).

Armor: reduce damage by armor_value, then apply a minimum-throughput floor (≥15%).

Movement: approach speed (or boost_speed) using (boost) acceleration; cap angular rates by turning_speed; responsiveness via turning_acceleration.

Inertial Compensation: trims velocity toward forward; higher = less drift.

Energy: power_points & power_recovery_per_sec govern weapons/PD/EW; Command ships trend highest.

Sensors: DRADIS detects (base→max); Visual grants ID.

FTL: allowed if distance ≤ ftl_range; pay ftl_cost×distance; obey ftl_charge_time and ftl_cooldown; interdiction rules if present.

B) Ship Encyclopedia (drop-in sections; one per ship)

How to add ships: Copy the template, fill with exact panel values. Mark any blue stat as (+Δ) and compute the advanced total.

Confirm purchase currency icon.

Clarify whether FTL Cost is flat per jump (as shown) or per-LY in your rule set.

If an Advanced Raptor FR exists in your data, provide its pane so we can add upgrade deltas (+Δ) for any blue stats/slots.

ESCORT CLASS

(Add per-ship sections here — e.g., Scythe, Glaive (Command), Maul …)

LINE CLASS

(Add per-ship sections here — e.g., Gungnir, Vanir (Command), Aesir, Jotunn …)

CAPITAL CLASS

(Add per-ship sections here — e.g., Brimir carrier, Surtur, battlestars …)

C) QA & Balance Guardrails (reference)

Duels (same tier): 8–14 s TTK target bands.

Energy sustain: baseline builds ≥8–10 s of continuous fire + maneuver; Advanced +15–25%.

Mobility ladder: Strike > Escort > Line > Capital.

Sensors ladder: Larger hulls trend to higher DRADIS; Visual rises modestly.

FTL: Bigger hulls → longer Range and higher Cost; Command frames may have transponder discounts.

Slot identity: Enforce role signatures (Interceptor=Engine, Assault=Hull, Command=Computer) on base & Advanced.
