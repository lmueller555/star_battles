SHIP_GUIDANCE (Scalable Edition — with Upgradeable Stat Model)
A) Global Rules (apply to every ship)

Size classes: Strike (light) • Escort (medium) • Line (heavy) • Capital (XL).
Roles: Interceptor (extra Engine slots), Assault (extra Hull slots), Command (extra Computer slots + highest energy), Multi-Role (balanced).
Advanced variants: Each base hull has an Advanced version with modest stat bumps, +1 in its role’s signature slot family (Command: Computer; Interceptor: Engine; Assault: Hull), and extra Power Capacity/Recovery to sustain added modules.

A.1 Canonical Spec Fields & Units

These fields appear on the in-game ship panel. Record exact values and mark any upgradeable fields with a base value and a delta (the blue number on your panel).

Identity

name, class (Strike/Escort/Line/Capital), role, level_requirement, faction_counterpart, upgrade_to (Advanced …).

Economy

purchase_cost (currency), upgrade_cost (to Advanced), operating: boost_cost (Tylium/sec), ftl_cost (Tylium/LY or as displayed).

Equipment slot types for Strike/Escort/Line/Capital (use 0 when unsupported): weapons, hull, engine, computer.
Weapon subfamilies (if UI shows them): gun, launcher, defensive weapon, special weapon.
Special weapon slots can only be equipped with weapons marked as special weapons. If none exist, this slot is empty.
There are 2 types of defensive weapons currently: Point Defense and Flak Battery. These are only available to Line and Capital class ships.

When the panel shows counts like “4(+1)”, store:

base: 4

advanced_delta: +1

advanced_total: 5

Hull / Survivability

hull_points, hull_recovery_per_sec, durability, armor_value, critical_defense.

Engine / Mobility

Linear: speed (m/s), boost_speed (m/s), acceleration (m/s²), boost_acceleration (m/s²), boost_cost (Tyl/s).

Angular: turning_speed (deg/s) (or per-axis), turning_acceleration (deg/s²) (or pitch/yaw/roll speed & accel if available), roll_speed, roll_acceleration.

Handling: inertial_compensation (m/s), strafe_speed, strafe_acceleration.

Evasion: avoidance, avoidance_fading.

FTL

ftl_range (LY), ftl_charge_time (s), ftl_cooldown (s), ftl_cost (Tylium/LY), optional transponder_power_cost.

Energy & Sensors / EW

power_points (capacity), power_recovery_per_sec, firewall_rating, emitter_rating, dradis_range_base (m), dradis_range_max (m), visual_range (m).

Environmental

max_radiation_level, radioactive_decay, radioresistance.

Notes

Frame traits (e.g., wide firing arcs), role bonuses (e.g., transponder discounts), pre-installed systems.

A.2 Upgradeable Fields (from the blue stats on your panel)

Fields that can show a blue delta (meaning the Advanced variant increases them):

Slots: weapons, engine, sometimes others (UI shows the + in parentheses)

Hull: hull_points, hull_recovery_per_sec, durability

Mobility: turning_speed, acceleration, speed, boost_speed

Energy: power_points
(If other fields display in blue on other frames, add them as upgradeable for those ships.)

Recording convention: For any upgradeable field, store base, advanced_delta, and advanced_total = base + advanced_delta. Do not invent deltas—only use the UI numbers.

A.3 Behavioral Formulas (text only)

Hit chance: hit = clamp01( (AttackerAccuracy − DefenderAvoidance) / scale ).

Critical: critChance = clamp01(BaseCrit + AttackerCrit − DefenderCriticalDefense).

Armor: reduce damage by armor_value, then apply a minimum-throughput floor (≥15%).

Movement: approach speed (or boost_speed) using (boost) acceleration; cap angular rates by turning_speed; responsiveness via turning_acceleration.

Inertial Compensation: trims velocity toward forward; higher = less drift.

Energy: power_points & power_recovery_per_sec govern weapons/PD/EW; Command ships trend highest.

Sensors: DRADIS detects (base→max); Visual grants ID.

FTL: allowed if distance ≤ ftl_range; pay ftl_cost×distance; obey ftl_charge_time and ftl_cooldown; interdiction rules if present.

B) Ship Encyclopedia (drop-in sections; one per ship)

How to add ships: Copy the template, fill with exact panel values. Mark any blue stat as (+Δ) and compute the advanced total.

Implementation Notes (use these as the coder’s checklist)

Hardpoints/Arcs: 4 weapon mounts; treat as medium-class hardpoints with escort-typical lateral coverage. No special dorsal/ventral coverage rules for Scythe (unlike Glaive).

Interceptor feel: Keep the control response snappy: enforce high turning accel (25 deg/s²) and noticeable drift with modest inertial compensation (50 m/s).

TTK & stamina guardrails: despite low armor, the 7.8/s hull regen lets it reset between skirmishes; ensure sustained boost is limited by 10/s power recharge and 1.5 tyl/s drain.

Advanced upgrade hooks: add +1 Engine slot; increase Power to comfortably support an extra engine mod (+10–20 capacity, +1–2/s recharge), leave survivability nearly unchanged to preserve role identity.

Role & Upgrade Notes

Assault identity: gains more Hull slots than other Escort roles; Advanced Maul adds +1 Hull slot (and minor energy/survivability bumps).

Designed to trade speed/turn for armor and sustained presence on objective.

Frame Traits & Design Intent

Largest of the three Escort frames; reinforced plating and high durability.

Best used as a frontline screen or station guard; pairs well with Command escorts that supply buffs/ECM.

Weaknesses: slowest handling among escorts; vulnerable to kiting and EW drain if isolated.

Implementation Checklist

Enforce slot family sizes (all Medium).

Apply Assault role rule (+Hull slots, +1 more when upgraded).

Verify boost drain vs recharge allows ~8–10 s of continuous boost with typical engine modules.

Validate TTK vs peers: Maul should outlast Scythe/Glaive in equal DPS trades but lose chase potential.

Traits & role notes

Heavy Command line ship with a large energy pool and strong computer capacity for EW/support builds.

Plays as a mobile anchor: slow handling but durable with solid long-range sensors; excels when screened by Escorts/Strikes and when fielded as a missile/energy-support platform.

CAPITAL CLASS

Capital — Brimir (Role: Carrier)
Identity

Class / Role: Capital · Carrier
Level Requirement: 40
Counterpart / Upgrade To: (TBD) / Advanced Brimir
Lore / Description:

Discovery of the derelict shipyards near Delta Canopis has allowed the construction of the Brimir-class carrier.
The carrier is a support and logistics vessel that allows strike ships to coordinate attacks and quickly repair and refit away from an outpost.

Pre-installed Systems

None explicitly listed on panel.
(You may later add entries for onboard repair drones, strike coordination array, or hangar repair field if implemented as built-in systems.)

Traits & Role Notes

Carrier-class Capital ship, optimized for fleet support and strike coordination.

Provides mobile repair and refit capabilities for allied Strike and Escort craft while away from outposts.

Balanced defensive armament (4 guns, 2 launchers, 4 defensive, 4 special) allows it to defend itself without matching a battleship’s raw damage output.

Moderate FTL reach (12 LY) for a Capital ship — adequate for long-range deployments.

Excellent energy and EW suite (1,000 capacity, 40/s recovery) supports sustained drone operations, PD systems, and EW defenses.

Limited agility (8–9°/s turning) and minimal avoidance (20) — relies on escorts and fleet positioning for protection.

Command-center design enables coordination bonuses when operating near allied squadrons (if your fleet aura systems model these).

Armor (40) and Critical Defense (150) values make it resilient against both kinetic and energy weapon fire.

Open Items / TBD

Confirm purchase currency (Tylium vs Cubits).

Verify FTL Cost model (flat vs per-LY).

If Advanced Brimir exists, capture any “blue” deltas (e.g., +Hull, +Power, +Slots) and record them in the +Δ fields per your canonical upgrade schema.

If carrier drone or repair-field modules are implemented as pre-installed, add those under Pre-installed Systems.

Identity

Class / Role: Capital · Siege
