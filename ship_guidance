SHIP_GUIDANCE (Scalable Edition)
A) Global Rules (apply to every ship)

Size classes: Strike (light) • Escort (medium) • Line (heavy) • Capital (XL).
Roles: Interceptor (extra Engine slots), Assault (extra Hull slots), Command (extra Computer slots + highest energy), Multi-Role (balanced).
Advanced variants: each base hull has an Advanced version with modest stat bumps, +1 in its signature slot family (Command: Computer; Interceptor: Engine; Assault: Hull), and extra Power Capacity/Recharge to sustain the added slots.

Spec fields every ship defines (units in parentheses):

Identity: name, class, role, level req, counterpart, upgrade path.

Economy: purchase cost (currency), upgrade cost (to Advanced), operating costs: Boost Cost (Tylium/sec), FTL Cost (Tylium/LY).

Slots: Weapons / Hull / Engine / Computer (Capitals: Guns / Launchers / Defensive Weapons instead of “Weapons”).

Hull: Hull Points (HP), Hull Recovery (HP/s), Durability, Armor Value, Critical Defense.

Engine/Mobility: Speed & Boost Speed (m/s), Boost Cost (Tyl/s), Acceleration & Boost Accel (m/s²), Pitch/Yaw/Roll Speed (deg/s), Pitch/Yaw/Roll Accel (deg/s²), Inertial Compensation (m/s), Strafe Speed/Accel (if any), Avoidance, Avoidance Fading.

FTL: Range (LY), Charge Time (s), Cooldown (s), Cost (Tyl/LY).

Energy & Sensors: Power Points (capacity), Power Recovery (/s), Firewall Rating, Emitter Rating, Base DRADIS Range (m), Maximum DRADIS Range (m), Visual Range (m).

Environmental: Max Radiation Level, Radioactive Decay, Radioresistance.

Notes: frame traits (e.g., broad arcs), role bonuses (e.g., transponder discounts), pre-installed systems.

Behavioral formulas & notes (textual, no code):

Hit chance: compare Attacker Accuracy vs Defender Avoidance → clamp to [0,1].

Crit: (BaseCrit + Attacker bonus − Defender Critical Defense) → on hit, apply crit multiplier.

Armor: subtract Armor Value after penetration; ensure a minimum damage floor (e.g., ≥15% gets through).

Movement: target Cruise/Boost speed; approach using (Boost) Acceleration; cap angular rates by Pitch/Yaw/Roll Speed; responsiveness via angular Accel.

Inertial Compensation: higher = faster auto-trim of drift toward forward.

Energy: Power Points + Power Recovery fuel weapons/PD/EW; Command frames have the highest baselines; Advanced increases all roles appropriately.

Sensors: DRADIS for detection; Visual for close ID; Firewall vs Emitter for EW contests.

FTL: allowed if distance ≤ Range, pay Cost = (Tyl/LY)×distance, obey Charge and Cooldown, obey interdiction rules if present.

B) Ship Encyclopedia (paste-in sections; one per ship)

How to grow this: When you add a ship, copy the “Per-ship section template” block and fill it with values shown on the game panel(s). If a field isn’t shown, leave it TBD and we’ll fill it when you share that panel.

ESCORT CLASS

(Add per-ship sections here as you share panels — e.g., Scythe, Glaive, Maul…)

LINE CLASS

(Add per-ship sections here — e.g., Gungnir, Aesir, Vanir, Jotunn…)

CAPITAL CLASS

(Add per-ship sections here — e.g., Brimir / Surtur carriers, battlestars…)

C) QA & Balance Guardrails (quick reference)

Duels (same tier): 8–14s TTK target bands.

Energy sustain: baseline builds ≥8–10s continuous fire + maneuver; Advanced +15–25%.

Mobility ladder: Strike > Escort > Line > Capital.

Sensors ladder: Larger hulls trend to higher DRADIS; Visual increases only modestly.

FTL: Bigger hulls tend to longer Range and higher Cost; Command frames may have transponder discounts.

Slot identity: Enforce role signatures (Interceptor=Engine, Assault=Hull, Command=Computer) on base & Advanced.
